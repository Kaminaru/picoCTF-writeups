## Solution
From the hit we know that start of the flag will look like this: PICOCTF. So we know that: 16 - P | 9 - I | 3 - C | 15 - O | 20 - T | 6 - F.
So by following numbers in alphabet we can decrypt the numbers on the picture one by one.
|A - 1|<br/>
|B - 2|<br/>
|C - 3|<br/>
|D - 4|<br/>
  ...

**Flag**: PICOCTF{THENUMBERSMASON}
